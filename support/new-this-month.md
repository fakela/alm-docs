# New This Month: November

*Use this file only for months with extensive changes.*

November saw Account Lifecycle Manager add New Account Notifications (an Account Discovery feature), ALM Engine Calibration (a Vault tool), and more usable Vault Detail pages, which now sport a tabbed interface. You can also opt to try out the beta release of a tool that will streamline the processes for setting up ALM Engines.

## New Account Notifications

October saw the addition of the Active Directory Account Discovery Tool, which provided bulk discovery and import of extant AD accounts when introducing ALM to the enterprise or extending its reach. With this November’s update, you can catch new accounts as they appear—when ALM discovers new accounts in AD that have been created with no corresponding managed account record in ALM, it sends an email naming the AD accounts to the System Administrator.

ALM includes a Webhook for this event notification, allowing you to set up additional events to occur automatically when ALM finds unmanaged accounts in AD.

## ALM Engine Calibration

ALM can automatically assess which ALM Engines can connect to what Secrets vaults and directory services. MSPs may particularly embrace this tool, as they often must deal with multiple Secrets vaults and AD environments.

## Tabbed Interface for Vault Detail Pages

The tabbed interface now applied to Vault Detail pages increases the volume of information available for ready perusal, while making the User interface less cluttered.

## Beta Feature Release: ALM Engine Configuration Website Tool

On successful installation of an ALM Engine on a machine, a website hosted locally on that machine will be set to automatically load to provide an interface and toolset for configuring the Secret Server vault, setting up the External Domain (Active Directory), and creating ALM Engine Pools. This should streamline the overall setup process for ALM Engines.

In this November beta release of the feature it has been set not to autoload. To learn how you can try out this beta feature, see [Setup the ALM Engine Service](../get-started/setup-alm-engine/).
