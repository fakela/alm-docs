# Create ALM Users

Because ALM is based in the Thycotic cloud, each member of your organization who will use ALM must have two distinct accounts.

* First, they must have a **Thycotic One** account. These free accounts provide authentication to Thycotic’s cloud services.

* To open a Thycotic One account, visit *login.thycotic.com*.

If your organization has previously used Thycotic cloud services, some members of your organization may already have Thycotic One accounts.

The email a person uses to sign up for Thycotic One determines the email that must be used for that person’s ALM user account.

Your organization sets up ALM user accounts in your ALM provision. Unlike Thycotic One accounts, which are not specific to ALM, the ALM user accounts will exist only within ALM, so none of your staff will already have one.

Thycotic refers to ALM accounts and the people who use them as “users,” without distinction.

* To create ALM user accounts for your organization’s members, go to **Users \> Create User**.

* Assign a **Display Name** and set the user’s **Email Address**.

* The email address should match the one used to open the user’s Thycotic One account.

* Add the user to ALM Groups, as appropriate for the user.

* **Save** the new user record.

Continue until you have created the ALM users that enable your organization’s use cases.
