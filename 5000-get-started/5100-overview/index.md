# Overview

Preparing for ALM requires these tasks:

* Requirements Verification

  Despite ALM’s Cloud basis, requirements apply to your organization’s IT infrastructure.

  After provisioning, but before any users log in to ALM, your organization should verify it has met these requirements.

  These pages include detailed information about the requirements.

* Initial Setup: Outside ALM

  ALM requires installation of a Windows Service, referred to as the ALM Remote Worker, on your organization’s hardware. Additionally, you must integrate ALM with Secret Server and connect it to Active Directory.

    These pages include instructions for those tasks.

* Initial Setup: Within ALM

  You must complete certain setup tasks within your freshly provisioned cloud ALM environment for the service to work as designed.

  Most of these tasks will require your IT organization’s participation. Others would benefit from early involvement by those who set technical standards for your organization, for example, user account naming conventions.

  These pages include detailed coverage of these first ALM setup tasks.
