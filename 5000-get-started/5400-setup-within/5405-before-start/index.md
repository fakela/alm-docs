### Before You Start

After Thycotic provisions your organization, you will have access to ALM.

* Ensure that non-administrative users **do not log in** to ALM until your organization completes all setup tasks.

* Some tasks require your IT staff to take part, so you should coordinate with your IT organization in setting the date and time you perform these tasks.

These ALM setup tasks occur entirely within your cloud ALM environment:

* plan for groups, roles, and users

* create groups, roles, and users

* add users and groups to roles

* build Workflow templates for approval processes

* using the Workflow templates, create Workflows
