## Initial Setup: Within ALM

ALM assigns the **all-privileged** System Administrator role to **the account that first logs in** to your organization’s ALM provision.

Having the System Administrator role privileges the account to perform not just the setup tasks described here, but any and all other ALM tasks.

* While your account has these elevated privileges, you should take extra care when making changes, and approach each setup task deliberatively.

* Best practices forbid that any user routinely log in using an account with System Administrator privileges on the off chance they might end up needing to perform administrative tasks.

* Use highly privileged accounts only for tasks that require the privileges. Log out of the privileged accounts when you complete the tasks.

* Remember: with the power to **do anything** you can accidentally **damage everything**. Be careful. Cloud environments lack the pervasive “edit undo” capacity common to traditional on-premises systems.

Related to this concern, when these first setup tasks are complete, be sure to contact your IT organization to **align ALM with your organization’s Privileged Access Management policies**.
