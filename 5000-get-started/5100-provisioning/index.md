# Provisioning

Because Thycotic offers Account Lifecycle Manager as a cloud service, you do not deploy ALM on your organization’s private infrastructure.

Instead, Thycotic technical staff **provision** cloud-hosted configurations and settings that authorize browser-based access to ALM by members of your organization. Broadly speaking, provisioning is simply granting access.

Thycotic also uses the word ‘provision’ as a noun referring to the totality of access to ALM granted to an organization and the organization’s specific setup. Your organization’s **ALM provision** is its ALM access and setup specifics.

For information about provisioning, reach out to your Thycotic contact. These pages do not describe provisioning, as it is a transparent process for Thycotic’s customers.

After Thycotic provisions your organization, you will have access to ALM.

* Ensure that nobody starts using ALM before you have completed all setup tasks.

* Some tasks may require your IT staff to take part; coordinate with your IT providers before performing any of these tasks.

## ALM Objects are Objects Forever

A major part of getting started with ALM is creating the Groups, Roles, Users, and Workflow Templates that will work best for your organization.

* Take time to plan your creation of these many objects, because ALM does not support deleting objects, only disabling them. A little advance planning at the outset will keep your ALM provision tidy for the long haul.
