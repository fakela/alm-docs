# Release Notes

The August 2019 release of Account Lifecycle Manager marked the product’s first General Availability release.

Thycotic expects to periodically update Account Lifecycle Manager, such as to provide fixes and improvements or to introduce additional features.

* As a cloud application, ALM lacks version numbers, because updates become available to all users as they occur—the current version is always the only version available.

To promote customer awareness, Thycotic will populate the following table to document changes to ALM.
