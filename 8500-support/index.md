# Support

ALM subscribers have access to support by phone and email. You also can open a case in Thycotic’s support ticketing system, which promotes follow-through to issue resolution.

## Support by Phone

To obtain support by phone you must first login to the Support Portal to obtain a PIN. You must provide the PIN when you call to show that your license includes support. The PIN also makes it easier for the person helping you to locate your customer records, promoting a better support experience.

* Visit the [Support Portal Login Page](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/login/) using the credentials you received when your organization subscribed to the ALM service.

* After logging in, you will be on the main page. Click on the large blue bar labeled PIN to obtain a PIN number. Write this down so you will have it ready when you call.
