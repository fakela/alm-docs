# Operations

Routine operations for ALM involve straightforward tasks with few steps.

## Sign In to ALM

Navigate to your organization’s ALM URL.

* Use **Sign In** to visit Thycotic One for authentication.

After you authenticate, Thycotic One will display your ALM Dashboard.

## Request a Service Account

Use these steps to request a new service account via the approval process set by a specific Workflow Template:

* Use the **Create New Request** button to open the Workflow Templates page.
* Select a Workflow Template to control the approval process for the Account Request.
* Supply an **Account Name**.
* Write a **Justification and Reason Statement** for the Account Request. Approvers review this.
* Choose the **Review Interval** for the account. The Workflow Template controls the available selection of Review Intervals.
* Determine whether the account will have the ability to add Users as Account Owners.
* Review the **Approval Steps** that apply to this Request.
* Submit the Request.

## Workflow Execution

The workflow proceeds unless you withdraw the Request. At any time, you can withdraw the Request at your Dashboard by deleting it.

## Notifications of Requests

When you submit the Request, ALM will notify the Approver that the Request needs their attention.

## Approve or Deny a Request

The Approver (or multiple Approvers) listed for Approval Step 1 in the Request record will review the Request and decide the outcome:

* **Approve** provisions the account for the Requester. The Requester receives a Notification of the Approval.
* **Deny** requires the Approver to record the reason for denying the Request. The Requester receives a Notification of the denial and the reason given.
