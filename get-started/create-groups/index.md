# Create Groups

**Groups** identify by inclusion users who share the same privileges.

* ALM groups do **not** correspond to Active Directory groups.

  They are ALM objects used to control ALM user privileges, entirely within ALM.

* To create groups, go to **Groups \> Create Group**.

* Type a name for the group.

* **Add** the new group to ALM.

Continue creating groups until you have created the ALM groups required for your organization’s ALM use cases.
