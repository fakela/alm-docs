# Active Directory Account Discovery Tool

The AD Account Discovery Tool allows System Administrators to select any or all service accounts within a specific domain and import them to ALM, where they can be managed by aassociating them with Workflow Templates and assigning Owners.

Located under Administration > Account Discovery, the tool presents a simple four-step process for bringing AD service accounts under ALM management:

* select the domain
* select accounts within the domain
* assign the selected accounts to Workflow Templates
* assign users and groups as owners to the accounts
