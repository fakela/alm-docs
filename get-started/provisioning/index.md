# Provisioning

Because Thycotic offers Account Lifecycle Manager as a cloud service, you do not deploy ALM on your organization’s private infrastructure.

Instead, Thycotic technical staff provision cloud-hosted configurations and settings that authorize browser-based access to ALM by members of your organization. Broadly speaking, provisioning is simply granting access.

For information about provisioning, reach out to your Thycotic contact. These pages do not describe provisioning, as it is a transparent process for Thycotic’s customers.

After Thycotic provisions your organization, you will have access to ALM.

* Ensure that nobody starts using ALM before you have completed all setup tasks.

* Some tasks may require your IT staff to take part; coordinate with your IT providers before performing any of these tasks.
