# Start Using ALM

Having set up a Remote Worker; integrated ALM with Secret Server and Active Directory; planned and created your ALM Groups, Roles, and Users; added Users to Groups; added Users and Groups to Roles, and built Workflow Templates capturing your organization’s approval processes, you are ready to start using ALM.

* [Operations](../alm-operations/) describes routine activities in ALM.

* [Administration](../alm-admin/) details operations performed only occasionally, for example, managing Roles or administering Workflow Templates.
