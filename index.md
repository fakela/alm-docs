# Welcome to Account Lifecycle Manager Technical Assistance

Thycotic created this collection of short-form technical materials to quickly and directly connect you with answers to your ALM questions. We aim to conserve your time by applying brevity and focus at every turn.

The collection includes two parts, **Core** and **Extended**:

* Core Collection articles form the essential documentation set. These appear in the Navigation Panel at left, ordered as an ALM primer.

* The forthcoming [Extended Collection](./9000-extended/) will include KB-style articles, training materials, user bulletins, and discussion threads.
 
* The search box at upper right pulls results from the entire collection, both Core and (eventually) Extended.

The Navigation Panel’s headings pull together information supporting a solid grounding in Account Lifecycle Manager:

[Overview](./1000-alm-overview/) defines the Account Lifecycle Manager service in broad terms. It describes ALM as typically used and illustrates the service architecture.

[ALM Objects](./2000-alm-objects/) describes the four essential objects within ALM—Users, Roles, Groups, and Workflow Templates—and explains how ALM provides governance over service accounts using these objects and a system of End of Lifecycle Actions and related Notifications.

[Setup](./5000-get-started/) forms the bulk of this collection, describing steps from provisioning to setup inside and outside of ALM. Learn how to configure and customize ALM to fit your organization.

[Operations](./5500-alm-operations/) outlines tasks ALM users perform during normal operations.

[Administration](./6000-alm-admin/) describes administrative tasks such as updating templates.

[Tools](./8000-ref-items/) provides a guide to the free [Service Account Risk Snapshot Tool](./8000-ref-items/8400-discovery-tool/).

[Support](./8500-support/) connects you with our support staff. [Release Notes](./8500-support/8510-release-notes.md) post here, along with information pertinent to performance, regulatory, and compliance considerations (SLAs, SOC II, GDPR, and similar).

The [Extended Collection](./9000-extended/) will house a range of materials, most significantly KB-style articles.

Alongside this collection, Thycotic maintains an [Account Lifecycle Manager API Reference](https://thycotic.accountlifecyclecloud.com/docs/api-reference).
