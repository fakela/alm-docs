# Welcome to the Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) Technical Documentation Collection

This technical documentation collection for Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) includes short, topically focused, technically oriented material, including product descriptions, diagrams, instructions, general guidance, and reference content. The collection includes two parts, Core and Extended:

* Core Document Collection articles form the basic documentation set and appear in the Navigation Panel at left, ordered as an ALM primer.

* The [Extended Document Collection](./9000-extended/) has not yet been populated. It will include KB-style articles, and may include training materials, user bulletins, and discussion threads.
 
* The search box at upper right provides direct access to articles relevant to your search terms. It pulls results from the entire collection, both Core and (eventually) Extended.

The Navigation Panel’s headings pull together information supporting a solid grounding in Account Lifecycle Manager:

[ALM Overview](./1000-alm-overview/) defines the Account Lifecycle Manager service in broad terms. It describes ALM as typically used and illustrates the service architecture.

[ALM Objects](./2000-alm-objects/) describes the four essential objects within ALM—Users, Roles, Groups, and Workflow Templates—and explains how ALM provides governance over service accounts using these objects and a system of End of Lifecycle Actions and related Notifications.

The [User Interface Guide](./3000-ui-guide/) explains the ALM user interface essentials, depicting the simplicity and obviousness of the ALM UI. 

[ALM Setup](./5000-get-started/) presently forms the bulk of this collection, describing the major steps from initial provisioning to setup both inside and outside of ALM. It includes information about how to configure and customize ALM to fit your organization.

[ALM Operations](./5500-alm-operations/) lists and outlines the tasks ALM users will routinely perform when using ALM for typical purposes.

[ALM Administration](./6000-alm-admin/) describes administrative tasks such as updating templates.

[ALM Accessories](./8000-ref-items/) collects information about software accessories to ALM—so far, a guide to the free [Service Account Risk Snapshot Tool](./8000-ref-items/8400-discovery-tool/).

[Support Resources](./8500-support/) connects you to available product support and provides [Release Notes](./8500-support/8510-release-notes.md).

The [Extended Collection](./9000-extended/) claims a home for the forthcoming Extended Document Collection, which (as above) will include a range of materials, most significantly KB-style articles.

Additionally, apart from this collection, Thycotic maintains an [Account Lifecycle Manager API Reference](https://thycotic.accountlifecyclecloud.com/docs/api-reference).
