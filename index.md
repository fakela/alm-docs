# Welcome to the Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) Technical Documentation Collection

This technical documentation collection for Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) includes short, topically focused, technically oriented material, including product descriptions, diagrams, instructions, general guidance, and reference content.

* The search facility at upper right provides direct access to articles relevant to your search terms. It pulls results from the entire collection, both core and extended.

* The navigation panel (to the left) presents the core article collection ordered as an ALM primer. It also lists the most recent additions to the extended collection (typically Knowledge Base articles).

The navigation panel’s main headings collect all the information necessary to begin using Account Lifecycle Manager:

**ALM: The Big Picture** defines the service in broad terms, explaining its relationship to the Privileged Access Management (PAM) market and how it fits into Thycotic’s line of PAM products and services. The essay-form writing in this section equips you to judge whether and how ALM makes sense for your organization.

**ALM In One Minute** describes in just a minute’s worth of words what ALM does and how it works, complementing the broad sketches of the big picture by distilling everything ALM to a single, condensed work-flow walk-through.

**ALM Provisioning** reminds those new to cloud computing that although becoming an ALM subscriber requires no installation of boxed software, it does require your organization’s enterprise infrastructure to meet several criteria.

**Getting Started with ALM** presently forms the bulk of this collection, describing the major steps from initial provisioning to setup both inside and outside of ALM, with information about how to configure and customize the service to fit your organization.

**Normal Operations** lists and outlines the tasks ALM users will routinely perform during normal operations.

**Occasional Operations** recaps tasks ALM users will occasionally perform, such as updating templates.

**Reference Topics** collects reference material, including a Summary of ALM User Personas and Use Cases, a Guide to Service Account End of  Actions, and a Table of Events, Notifications, and Notification Recipients.

**Support Resources** connects you to available support resources.

**Release Notes** will document the history of changes and updates to the Account Lifecycle Manager service, moving forward. For this first General Availability launch of the ALM service, it simply notes the date and version number and that this is the first release.

Additionally, maintained independently of this collection, Thycotic provides an **Account Lifecycle Manager API Reference**.
