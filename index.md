# Welcome to the Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) Technical Documentation Collection

This technical documentation collection for Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) includes short, topically focused, technically oriented material, including product descriptions, diagrams, instructions, general guidance, and reference content.

* The search box at upper right provides direct access to articles relevant to your search terms. It pulls results from the entire collection, both core and extended.

* The navigation panel (to the left) presents the core article collection ordered as an ALM primer. It also lists the most recent additions to the extended collection (typically articles in the style of Knowledge Base, but may include other materials).

The navigation panel’s headings pull together information supporting a solid grounding in Account Lifecycle Manager:

[ALM Overview](./3000-alm-overview/) defines the Account Lifecycle Manager service in broad terms, explaining what ALM does and how it works and placing it in context alongside Thycotic’s other PAM products.

[ALM Provisioning](./4000-alm-prov/) reminds those new to cloud computing that although becoming an ALM subscriber requires no installation of boxed software, it does require your organization’s enterprise infrastructure to meet several criteria.

[Architecture and Security](./4500-architecture/) describes the external architecture of ALM, with attention to security matters, including SOC II.

[Get Started with ALM](./5000-get-started/) presently forms the bulk of this collection, describing the major steps from initial provisioning to setup both inside and outside of ALM, with information about how to configure and customize the service to fit your organization.

[Operational ALM](./6000-alm-operations/) lists and outlines the tasks ALM users will routinely perform when using ALM for typical purposes.

[Administrative ALM](./7000-alm-admin/) describes administrative tasks such as updating templates.

[ALM In Depth](./8000-ref-items/) provides additional depth for several topics; it includes the ALM Roles Guide and the End of Lifecycle Actions Guide.

[Support Resources](./9000-support/) connects you to available product support.

[Release Notes](./9400-rel-notes/) will document the history of changes and updates to the Account Lifecycle Manager service. For this first General Availability launch of the ALM service, it simply notes the date and version number and that this is the first release.
