Thycotic created this collection of short-form technical materials to quickly and directly connect you with answers to your ALM questions. We aim to conserve your time by applying brevity and focus at every turn.

* When you have a specific topic in mind, the search tool at upper right will be your quickest path to relevant articles.
* For browsing, the Navigation Panel (menus at left) pulls together information supporting a solid grounding in Account Lifecycle Manager.

[Overview](./alm-overview/) defines the Account Lifecycle Manager service in broad terms. It describes ALM as typically used and illustrates the service architecture.

[ALM Objects](./alm-objects/) describes the four essential objects within ALM—Users, Roles, Groups, and Workflow Templates—and explains how ALM provides governance over service accounts using these objects and a system of End of Lifecycle Actions and related Notifications.

[Setup](./get-started/) forms the bulk of this collection, describing steps from provisioning to setup inside and outside of ALM. Learn how to configure and customize ALM to fit your organization.

[Operations](./alm-operations/) outlines tasks ALM users perform during normal operations.

[Administration](./alm-admin/) describes administrative tasks such as updating templates.

[Tools](./ref-items/) provides a guide to the free [Service Account Risk Snapshot Tool](./ref-items/discovery-tool/).

[Support](./support/) connects you with our support staff. [Release Notes](./support/release-notes.md) post here, along with information pertinent to performance, regulatory, and compliance considerations (SLAs, SOC II, GDPR, and similar).

Alongside this collection, Thycotic maintains an [Account Lifecycle Manager API Reference](https://thycotic.accountlifecyclecloud.com/docs/api-reference).
