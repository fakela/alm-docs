# Occasional Operations

Some operations will be performed only occasionally, for example, managing roles or administering workflows.

## Manage Roles

To enable or disable a role:

* Go to **Roles \> [Select Role] \> Manage Role**.

* Use **Edit** to adjust the name of the role.

* Use **Enable** or **Disable** to recommission or decommission a role, respectively.

Newly created roles will be automatically enabled.

## Manage Groups

On the **Manage Groups** page you can edit the group name, disable or enable the group, and add users to the group.

* To add a user to this group, click **Add User**.

* Enter search criteria.

* Select a user from the list of results.

* Click **Add**.

## Manage Users

On the **Manage User** page you can

* edit the user **Display Name**

* disable or enable the user account

* add an email address

* assign the user to groups and roles

## Workflow Administration

System Administrators can replace published Workflow Templates with updated versions, or publish updated versions alongside the earlier versions. The UI used to create the Templates also supports updating them.

ALM tracks sequential Workflow Template versions to associate the provisioning of each account with the version of the template that controlled the approval process for the account.
