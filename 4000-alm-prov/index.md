# ALM Provisioning

Because Thycotic offers Account Lifecycle Manager as a cloud service, you do not deploy ALM on your organization’s private infrastructure.

Instead, Thycotic technical staff **provision** cloud-hosted configurations and settings that authorize browser-based access to ALM by members of your organization. Broadly speaking, provisioning is simply granting access.

Thycotic also uses the word provision as a noun referring to the totality of access to ALM granted to an organization and the organization’s specific setup. Your organization’s **ALM provision** is its ALM access and setup specifics.

For information about provisioning, reach out to your Thycotic contact. These pages do not describe provisioning, as it is a transparent process for Thycotic’s customers.

## On-Premises ALM?

No, and yes. Thycotic does not offer ALM as COTS. However, Thycotic will provide on-premises installations of private ALM instances to organizations who request it and have the staff capacity.

* On-premises setup is by contractual arrangement, and entails collaboration between your organization’s and Thycotic’s technical and project management staff.

Your Thycotic representative can provide more information about on-premises deployments.
